# dnscheck

## Introduction

`dnscheck` is a tool that reads a list of domains from a file and checks them for the following issues:

- CNAME records pointing to an unclaimed resource (e.g. S3 bucket, GitHub pages, Azure CloudApp, etc.)
- CNAME records pointing to an unregistered domain
- Zone delegations poiting to an unclaimed zone

Detection of CNAMEs pointing to unclaimed resources is based on the information available
in [can-i-takeover-xyz](https://github.com/EdOverflow/can-i-take-over-xyz).

## Yet another DNS takeover tool?

Yes! Because:

1. I wanted to understand these vulnerabilities better, and what's better for that than writing a tool to detect them?
2. I couldn't find a tool that I liked enough and that would check both dangling CNAMEs and zone takeovers.
   (which doesn't mean such a tool doesn't exist!)

If you like this tool, use it  (I'll be happy if you do), if you want to improve it, please open
an issue, or even better, submit a PR, and if you don't like it, a list of [alternatives](#alternatives) is provided
below.

## Usage

### Installation

#### From sources

Clone the repository and build the application:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mdeous/dnscheck
cd dnscheck
make
```

You can then use the `dnscheck` binary that has been generated in the repository folder.

or

Install the application directly with Go:

```shell
go install https://github.com/mdeous/dnscheck@latest
```

You should then have `dnscheck` available in your `PATH` (assuming you have a properly configured Go environment).

#### Pre-built binaries

Pre-built binaries for the most common architectures can be downloaded from the
project's [latest release page](https://github.com/mdeous/dnscheck/releases/latest).
After downloading it, simply make the file executable and run it as described below.

### Checking domains for vulnerabilities

Domains to be checked can be provided either in bulk via a file passed to the `-D`/`--domains-file`
argument, or as a single domain passed to the `-d`/`--domain` argument. For nore control over the scan
behavior, please refer to the other arguments as described below.

Help:

```
‚ùØ dnscheck check -h
Check for vulnerable domains

Usage:
  dnscheck check [flags]

Flags:
  -d, --domain string         single domain to check
  -D, --domains-file string   file containing domains to check (default "domains.txt")
  -h, --help                  help for check
  -n, --nameserver string     server and port to use for name resolution (default "8.8.8.8:53")
  -o, --output string         file to write findings to
  -t, --timeout uint          timeout for HTTP requests (default 10)
  -w, --workers int           amount of concurrent workers (default 10)

Global Flags:
  -f, --fingerprints string   custom service fingerprints file
  -v, --verbose               increase application verbosity
```
